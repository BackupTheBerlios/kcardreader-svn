You need the SVN version of libchipcard2, in the offical
release is a small bug. I can't use the libchipcard library
wit my tool.

Q: Why?
A: The libchipcard library have a unresolved symbols in the function
     of kvk card (LC_KVKCard_ExtendCard and LC_KVKCard_GetCardData).
     This is fixed in the SVN version of libchipcard.

Q: Why can not read the load/unloaded money in Money (Max, Min, Transfer) tab?
A: The libchipcard library have a bug with LC_GeldKarte_ReadBLogs(..., ...).
     If this fixed from developer of libchipcard, than i enabled this.
