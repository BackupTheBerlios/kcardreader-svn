You need the SVN version of libchipcard2, in the offical
release is a small bug. I can't use the libchipcard library
wit my tool.

Q: Why?
A: The libchipcard library have a unresolved symbols in the function
     of kvk card (LC_KVKCard_ExtendCard and LC_KVKCard_GetCardData).
     This is fixed in the SCN version of libchipcard.
